I have previously sent you a message regarding a transaction worth ($9,820,000 ) Nine Million Eight Hundred and twenty Thousand United States Dollars left by my late client before his tragic death. \r\nI am contacting you once again because after going through your profile, I strongly believe that you will be in a better position to execute this business transaction with me. \r\nPlease if you are interested, I wish to point out that after the transaction I want 10% of this money to be donated among charity organizations while the remaining 90% will be shared equal by the both of us. \r\nThis transaction is 100% risk free; please respond to me as soon as possible for more detailed information. Here is my email: maxpierclaw@protonmail.com \r\nYours Faithfully, \r\nBarrister Maxwell Pierce","date":1561544917}
